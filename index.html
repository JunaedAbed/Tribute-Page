						"I am very saddened by this terrible news. I only met Sir Fazle once but had tremendous respect for his vision and drive to change the life of all those who are left behind, in Bangladesh and beyond. Please accept my very sincere condolences and may the extended Brac family carry on his legacy with the same commitment and success."
